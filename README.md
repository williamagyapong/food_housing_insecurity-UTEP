# Modeling Food and Housing Insecurity at The University of Texas at El Paso

This project is aimed at analyzing data based on a survey constructed in summer 2019 and 2020 by a team of researchers at UTEP to assess the state of food and housing insecurity among UTEP students. A slightly modified version of the survey was administererd summer 2020. The team wishes to assess whether there are any changes to food and housing insecurity since 2019. This is particularly important since the worldwide pandemic hit during this period. The primary and secondary research questions are listed below. 

## Research Questions:

* What factors are associated with food insecurity (FI) and housing insecurity (HI) among UTEP students?

* Secondary Research Question: Which subpopulations of students are most at risk for FI and HI at UTEP?
